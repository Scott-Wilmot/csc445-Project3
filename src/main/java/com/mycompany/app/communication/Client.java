     *     <li>Every other node remains a follower, and will only vote once per term</li>
     *     <li>Followers vote for a candidate â€” they do not vote for themselves unless they become a candidate</li>

     * If every candidate could vote for themselves, then it would reach a deadlock.
     * <p>
     * Step-by-Step Process:
     * <ol>
     *     <li>If a follower hasn't heard from a leader (heartbeat) within a timeout, it becomes a candidate.</li>
     *     <li>It increments its term, votes for itself, and sends RequestVote messages to all other nodes.</li>
     *     <li>The followers receive the vote request</li>
     *     <ol>
     *         <li>If the term of the received vote request is greater than or equal to its own term, it votes for that candidate. Then records it.</li>
     *         <li>Else if it's lower, it ignores the request.</li>
     *         <li>If it has already voted, it does not vote again.</li>
     *     </ol>
     *     <li> The candidate tallies its votes. If it's majority, it becomes leader.</li>
     *     <li> Else, waits for a timeout from another candidate, then restart the process.</li>
